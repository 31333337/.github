# 0KN 

## What is 0KN?

0KN is a next generation decentralized and incentivized metadata-private mixnet-based anonymous broadcast network with cryptographic security guarantees.
0KN is a decentralized privacy network infrastructure that is designed to preserve user anonymity in the face of an adversary monitoring the entire network and while assuming a fraction of all network servers are malicious. It leverages the next generation state-of-the-art mixnet based metadata-private anonymous broadcast **Trellis**.

## What's next? 
We are in a research phase and preparing public testnet in the following weeks. Currently you can use some Ansible playbooks to deploy things yourself and even scale it ona k3s cluster. 
- after robust testing and r&d we will start integrating this into Cosmos-sdk but that might come after some form of first testnet.
